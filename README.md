I had my name legally changed, but my SSN, personality, ethics and morality character didn't change (for the worse, just better).
Reducing identity fraud in your database and community will be very good thing to increase integrity and trust for your organization.
The most popular or most wealthy people aren't necessarily using actual identity because scam artists do carry multiple credit or debit cards with victims' names.

I was scammed out of working information technology since 1999, 1st college major change from Business Admin while mothering toddler, my oldest son, and I am sure other people were scammed too!
Did I write the code to give out ssn of myself and my kids to other people? No, I didn't. I wouldn't have had time to coordinate with others to commit crime AND I don't support identity fraud or immigration fraud!!!! Some malicious actors did bad stuff using my name, or had same name, on websites I never used because my achievement on Brainbench programming aptitude test from 1999 and computer science major then wasn't something they liked. I switched majors and colleges, delaying graduation, but like programming and computer languages.

If you want to create technology products or technology services that sell to women, then hiring women (of all races and religions) is a must:

Yes, I prefer remote work because of drama on Facebook that isn't me or my kids posting. I am conscientious independent worker. Why? Several people are competing for my identity, as programmer, tech manager and WGU graduate, but isn't authentic. One used different name when I knew him. He lived in my home (few months at a time - never on lease) with completely different name. I was tricked into feeling sorry for him, but I don't feel sorry anymore. I heard from others that he failed to deliver important message to me in 2011. I didn't know enough about him, so I regret having met him in 2011. I changed my mind about dating (anyone in future) because of several bad or misunderstood situations caused by old FB profiles prior to 2010, family gossip, and/or fake FB profiles still open, that won't result in me being trated with kindness. Obsession with twisting a poem about domestic violence into something bad to blame on me! I hate being scapegoated by a dozen people. Honestly, some just want me arrested for false charges and house empty because some people are scammers who get high when stealing.  

Don't beleive the mostly made-up sex scandals. Everyone does stupid stuff in their 20's, but I stopped doing stupid stuff by 1997:
Realisticly, I prefer chastity or brahmacharya spiritual path. I was born alone and I will die alone. 
What's Brahmacharya?

Can black people be Hindu? Absolutely. It's NOT cultural approriation to wear a sari or clothing or worship in an Hindu temple. 2 years ago writer in first artcile, "Contrary to popular belief, race is completely irrelevant to practice Hinduism. To see the divine in everyone and everything is a basic tenet of Hinduism." Everyone is Hindu in reality.

Directing sexual energy towards more positive or spiritual things, including healing and learning. 
I will have to work for income through my 70's as programmer, project manager or tech help desk, because of student loan debt and currently low wage, orlow interest, jobs offered to me.
If you have remote job that prefers independent workers who don't socialize and are very ethical, contact me. I need work, thanks, especially that doesn't bend ethics or morality for my spiritual, physical and emotional health. 

Seek peace within oneself, because there is no peace on Earth.
Namaste
